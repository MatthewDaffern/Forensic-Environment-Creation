Just my script that I'll be using to simplify my forensic environment install.

What this needs: Python 3 on Windows and Linux. It uses curl with files.io to generate a temporary link for downlading the files needed to move everything to windows.
		 This also uploads the Python 3 runtime and shell for using the script it'll upload onto files.io
		 So hopefully by doing this, I'll just require three clicks.
